EXCELLENT Based on 870 reviews. Wilson Hooi 2023-03-10 Replaced my old 5 years old Senz 3 burner electric stove with a brand new Senz 3 burner electric stove. Technicians came to install but unfortunately the new electric stove size doesn't fit in my existing kitchen stove hole. Senz technicians went extra miles to sand paper the existing hole to make the new Senz 3 burner to fit. Kudos to the technician teams and their dedication in completing the installation. Also kudos to their customer support team to make all the arrangements and provide useful information. Very happy Senz customer and will continue my support for Senz =) Muhammad Syamim 2023-03-09 Senz is my choice like 2 years before I even get my new house key. I was and still very confident of the quality of their product compared to other brands. Sure some people might not know the brand, but I recommend it to them just because of the quality. I bought the hood, the hob and the oven from SENZ and I can say the quality, the looks and the functions are top notch. Recently, a rare problem happen to my hob and I reported it to their CS. They quickly arranged for technician to come to my house to fix the issue. The technician (Kamal and 1 othe guy) just change a small part and he even taught me on how to take care of my hob and everything that I might've missed about the hob. It was great and useful. The aftersale service is great. I really recommend SENZ. Overall, I am super satisfied. kesav kesav 2023-03-07 Good and proper service Syahaniza Endut 2023-03-06 I was entertained by Bella the customer service and she was so efficient in handling my case where I‚Äôve received a damaged packaging.

(1) Q: What is the difference between open a hole and don‚Äôt open a hole in my kitchen? A: If you can open a hole in your kitchen we will suggest you to open a hole to extract the grease out. (2) Q: What if my place is not allowed to open a hole in the kitchen? A: 1) If you are not allowed to open a hole in your kitchen then you need to use our recirculation system to operate the Cooker Hood. Recirculation system consist of Aluminium Filter and Charcoal Filter. (3) Q: How‚Äôs the air going to flow out if we don‚Äôt open a hole in our kitchen? A:  If you are using recirculation system, please ensure that you have enough ventilation in your cabinet to allow clean air to flow. For example, some open ventilation holes on your cabinet door. This can also prevent your cabinet door from vibrating while operating the hood. (4) Q: What if my kitchen cabinet is made of glass? A: You can also open a hole at the top of your kitchen cabinet. (5) Q: What is the recommended installation height for Invisible Hood?                           A: The installation height should be according to your kitchen cabinet height; the recommend installation height is around 600mm (6) Q: Can I use electrtic drill to tighten the Cooker Hood? A : To avoid the clip from breaking easily, please do not tighten it with electric drill; use only screw driver to tighten it.

Again, we wish to clarify that SENZ have never made any claims that our products come with 10 years‚Äô warranty on spare parts and glass materials.
